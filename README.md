# Data Structures

This repository serves as a refresher of classic data structures used 
throughout computer science and software engineering. Data structures 
will be implemented in Python with other language implementations in 
the future.

## Project Layout

Each data structure has their own directory complete with an implementation 
and provided examples of how the structure may be used. A complete 
demonstration of each data structure and how they compare will be 
developed sometime in the future once the classic data structures have 
been implemented.
